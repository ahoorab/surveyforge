What is SurveyForge Classification?

    SurveyForge Classification is the core API within the SurveyForge project providing support for 
    classifications. A classification is a concept commonly used in statistical applications used
    to categorize possible values for a variable. Think of a typical survey with a question asking
    for the sex of the respondent. You may answer here male of female. Each of both answers is a
    category in the sex classification (Keep in mind this is a very simplistic example of a 
    classification, and the API is much richer than this).
    
    All the concepts, objects types and attributes are taken from the excellent work done by the
    Neuch√¢tel Group in their paper, version 2. Our intention is to provide a complete implementation
    of the paper, but right now we just implement the core concepts needed to support classifications
    (Family, Classfication, Version, Level and Item).
